      <description>I will be writing about some stuff I like about python, although I’m doing this through Rstudio and Rmarkdown.I’d been taking a few courses that use python and r, and since then, my main goto programming language has been python, r, or bash.
R is really nice in dealing with already structures data files, and I think is easier to work with when it comes to data analysis. But I think it’s easier to automate the analyses in python than in R (maybe I’m just more used to automating in python).</description>
